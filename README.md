This application uses Flask. Follow these steps to set up and run the app:

2. Create a virtual environment.

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Obtain the `.env` file containing the database connection string from a group member.

5. Navigate to the `server` directory.

6. Run the Flask app:
   ```
   flask run
   ```
7. In your terminal you should see where the app is running with something similar (or the same as) `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000` Copy and paste this local host address into your web browser, and you should have access to the application!
